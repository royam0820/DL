              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

        "NOTE:  As you can see, even on a pretty beefy GPU that takes two or three hours. In fact, I’m still underfitting. So probably tonight, I might train it overnight and try and do a little bit better. I’m guessing I could probably train this a bit longer because you can see the accuracy hasn’t started going down again. So I wouldn’t mind trying to train that a bit longer. But the accuracy, it’s interesting. 0.3 means we’re guessing the next word of the movie review correctly about a third of the time. That sounds like a pretty high number﹣the idea that you can actually guess the next word that often. So it’s a good sign that my language model is doing pretty well. For more limited domain documents (like medical transcripts and legal transcripts), you’ll often find this accuracy gets a lot higher. So sometimes this can be even 50% or more. But 0.3 or more is pretty good."

The current state of the art for IMDB classification is actually the algorithm that we built and published with colleague named Sebastian Ruder and what I just showed you is pretty much the state of the art algorithm with some minor tweaks. You can get this up to about 95% if you try really hard. So this is very close to the state of the art accuracy that we developed."

In the old days, the activation funtion most used was a sigmoid function, today we nearly always use the ReLu function (rectified linear unit), a sophiticated name to indicate that negative numbers will be equal to 0, the function is in fact: `max(x,0)`.\n",
